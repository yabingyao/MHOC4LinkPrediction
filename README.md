abstract = {In complex networks, link prediction can forecast missing links and identify spurious interactions has wide applications in the real world. Although the high-order structure plays a vital role in network evolution, its effect on link prediction is not always taken into consideration in traditional prediction algorithms. In this paper, we come up with a novel link prediction approach based on Mutual information of the High-Order Clustering structure (MHOC). The MHOC approach integrates the effects of multiple higher-order structures of nodes and quantifies the different contributions of common neighbors with the aid of the diverse high-order clustering coefficients of nodes based on information entropy for predicting missing links. Experimental results demonstrate that in the real world network, the high-order clustering patterns of nodes can improve link prediction accuracy significantly.}
